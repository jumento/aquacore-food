# Effects and Particles
# Based on average stats
# Ranges can be positive or negative (though stats are 0-100, so average is 0-100).
# "dividido en 2 positivos y negativos" -> Maybe the user means effects can be "good" (positive) or "bad" (negative) depending on range?
# Or maybe the stats can go negative? "esta puede ser positiva o negativa" (in command add).
# But "varia en un rango de 0 a 100, nunca mas o menos".
# So stats are 0-100.
# We will define ranges for effects.
