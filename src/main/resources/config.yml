# Regeneration Settings
# Based on the average of the 3 stats (0-100)
# Ranges are checked from top to bottom.
# Power: Regeneration amplifier (0 = Regen I, 1 = Regen II, etc. - though standard regen is usually just amount)
# Actually, Minecraft Regen effect heals based on amplifier.
# But the request says "potencia de 1 y una longitud de 0.010".
# "Longitud" might refer to the duration of the regen effect or the interval between heals if we implement custom regen.
# Given "longitud de 0.010", this looks like a very small number, possibly related to exhaust or saturation gain?
# Re-reading: "tendra una potencia de 1 y una longitud de 0.010"
# Maybe "longitud" implies saturation restoration amount or speed?
# Or maybe it's "Exhaustion" reduction?
# Let's assume "Power" is the regeneration amount/amplifier and "Length" is the duration or frequency modifier.
# However, standard Regen effect has Duration and Amplifier.
# Let's implement it as: We apply a Regeneration effect.
# Power = Amplifier.
# Length = Duration? 0.010 is too short for seconds.
# Maybe "Longitud" is the saturation added?
# "intervenir la saturacion... solo es incrementativa en base a 3 estadisticas"
# So maybe this defines how much saturation is added?
# Let's assume:
# Power = Amount of Saturation to add? Or Regen Amplifier?
# The prompt says: "activa la regeneracion... potencia de 1 y una longitud de 0.010"
# Let's interpret "Longitud" as "Saturation Amount" to add periodically, and "Potencia" as "Regen Amount" (HP).
# Or maybe "Longitud" is the exhaust level reduction?
# Let's stick to the user's terms in config and handle logic in code.

# Effects and Particles
# Based on average stats
# Ranges can be positive or negative (though stats are 0-100, so average is 0-100).
# "dividido en 2 positivos y negativos" -> Maybe the user means effects can be "good" (positive) or "bad" (negative) depending on range?
# Or maybe the stats can go negative? "esta puede ser positiva o negativa" (in command add).
# But "varia en un rango de 0 a 100, nunca mas o menos".
# So stats are 0-100.
# We will define ranges for effects.
